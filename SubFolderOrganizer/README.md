Are you as annoyed as us by tons of unorganized files in all you folders? And are you too lazy to spend hours trying to manually organize your folders?


Why don't you make your life easier? Write a bash script to automate the menial and boring task of going through all your files and seperating them manually. 


Your task is to write a bash script which organizes files of a folder by their extensions. Create subfolders in the main directory named ```Images, Vidoes and Audios, Compressed Files, Documents, Scripts, Others``` and move files based on their extensions into a respective subfolder. Note that you only need to know the basics and not any advanced Bash command to write this script easily.


Thing to Ponder Upon: Will the bash script you write itself move into the ```Scripts``` subfolder while or after executing? If so how can we prevent that?
